# API advanced
In this advanced API course, I expect to gain a deep understanding of various authentication and authorization methods, including OAuth and JWT, and learn how to implement them effectively. I look forward to mastering advanced RESTful API design principles, such as HATEOAS, and gaining hands-on experience with GraphQL, understanding when and how to use it in API development. I hope to acquire skills in error handling, input validation, caching strategies, and rate limiting techniques to optimize API performance. Additionally, I aim to explore advanced security practices, including encryption and protection against common attacks, and grasp effective API versioning strategies. I anticipate learning how to create comprehensive API documentation, set up automated testing, implement webhooks for real-time communication, and use analytics and monitoring tools to ensure optimal API performance. I also hope to gain expertise in containerization using technologies like Docker and orchestration with tools like Kubernetes, as well as strategies for performance optimization and compliance with legal regulations like GDPR when dealing with user data through APIs. Overall, I look forward to acquiring a comprehensive skill set that will enable me to design, build, and maintain robust and secure APIs.
